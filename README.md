# Cyclistic Analysis

Cyclistic is a successful bike sharing company which was launched on 2016. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5824 bicycles that are geo-tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago.The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the ﬂexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
